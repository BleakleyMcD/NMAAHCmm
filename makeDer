    A CRF value needs specified.
    The range of the quantizer scale is 0-51, where 0 is lossless, 23 is default, and 51 is worst possible.
    A lower value is a higher quality and a subjectively useful range is 18-28.
    Consider 18 to be visually lossless or nearly so: it should look the same or nearly the same as the input,
    but it is not technically lossless.
    The range is exponential, so increasing the CRF value +6 is roughly half the bitrate, while -6 is roughly twice the bitrate.
    General usage is to choose the highest CRF value that still provides an acceptable quality.
    If the output looks good, then try a higher value. If it looks bad then choose a lower value.

        printf "${BIWHITE}Please enter a CRF value: ${COLOR_OFF}"

    A preset encoding speed needs specified.
    A preset is a collection of options that will provide a certain encoding speed to compression ratio.
    A slower preset will provide better compression (compression is quality per filesize).
    This means that, for example, if you target a certain file size or constant bit rate,
    you will achieve better quality with a slower preset.
    Similarly, for constant quality encoding, you will simply save bitrate by choosing a slower preset.
    The general guideline is to use the slowest preset that you have patience for.
    Current presets in descending order of speed are:
EOF
    printf "${BIRED}ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow${COLOR_OFF}"
        echo
